# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Themes

## Installation

1. Copy a theme file like [big-sur-notes.css](/big-sur-notes.css) to `your vault folder/.obsidian/themes`.
2. In Obisidian's preferences select the theme (`big-sur-notes` for example) under the Appearance preferences.

You might also like to install Matthew Meyers's [recommended plugins](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-california-coast-theme#recommended-plugins) and [SF Pro font from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) to make Obsidian even better.

Enjoy!
