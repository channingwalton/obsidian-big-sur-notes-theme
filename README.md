# obsidian-big-sur-notes-theme

An obsidian theme based on Big Sur and Notes colours.

## Installation

There are two ways, see which you prefer:

### As a snippet with the big-sur theme

1. Copy the [big-sur theme](https://github.com/davidgolding/obsidian-big-sur-aesthetic/blob/main/obsidian.css) to `your vault folder/.obsidian/themes`. I suggest you rename it from `obsidian.css` to `big-sur.css`.
2. Copy [big-sur-notes.css](/big-sur-notes.css) to `your vault folder/.obsidian/snippets`.
3. In Obisidian's preferences select the `big-sur` theme and the `big-sur-notes` CSS snippet under the Appearance preferences.

###Â As a theme in its own right

1. Copy [big-sur-notes.css](/big-sur-notes.css) to `your vault folder/.obsidian/themes`.
2. In Obisidian's preferences select the `big-sur-notes` theme under the Appearance preferences.

You may also like to install the [SF Pro font from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) which the theme selects ahead of defaults.

Enjoy!
